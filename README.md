<h1>Selenium WebDriver Basics for Java</h1>
<p>
The example code contained within this repository was developed as supplementary materials for my Selenium WebDriver Course. The course covers the essential information a tester needs to begin developing browser automation scripts in Java, from installing a JDK and IDE through running tests using popular browser testing services. Each of the folders contains code corresponding to a section of the course and may not be complete, since some of the items are intended as exercises to be completed by the students.
